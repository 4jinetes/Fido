##Fully Integrated Defense Operation (FIDO)

FIDO is an automated incident response tool used to evaluate, assess and respond to malware. FIDOâ€™s primary purpose is to orchestrate the heavy manual effort needed to evaluate threats coming from today's security stack and the large number of alerts generated by them. As an orchestration tool FIDO can make using your existing security tools more accurate by being more efficient to detect, notify and respond to malware.
